# WhateverWeHaveMayNotBePerfectButItsEntertainingInsaneChallengingAndFunAndIDontThinkAnyoneElseHasThis

we have to pour all of this energy into n o m i a l ONE DAY i dunno when that is but one day

i made the decision years ago when i understood this situation had to do with penn all along, that i wanted to show to the judge that in the past 8 yrs that i didnt even get a parking ticket so my record is squeaky clean and that if i wanted you, i have no choice but to wait for you, and i have to reapply then ill suck it up and reapply -> so thats how im going to win this

and its not easy to do any of those things, its not easy at all
